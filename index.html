              <h1 class="history-title">Sondiha through the years!!!</h1>
              <p class="history text">When we all became independant and development started to thrieve in India even then our village was one of the villages where electricity was flowing through the wires. You can imagine how advance our village was by the facts that our forefathers were irrigating fields by usinng electric tubewell.All thanks to Sugar Mill located near by railway station Guraru. This sugar mill brought in many benefits like stable income.
              </p>  
              <p class="history text">In 60s the financial situation of mill started to degrade which led to its frequent opening and closing. The crop sugarcane sold to mill was the primary source of income for the population but the financial situation of the mill started to affect their livelihood. The electricity which came with sugar mill perished slowly in coming decades and lastly drown out in 90s. The early glory of village was lost meanwhile the people found other ways like IMIGRATION to lead a better life.
              </p>
              <p class="history text">Indeed it was a dark phase for the people but this led them emphasized on mass education. Even during independance literacy rate was higher than the national average but it lacked steady growth  and the villagers used to be Engineers or Farmers! This trend changed in 90s and upcoming decade 
                as people started to get employed in Service sector primarly govt services from top to bottom. We are always reputed as a village full of anger which we use on the enemies of the nation by serving in Armed Forces.</p>
